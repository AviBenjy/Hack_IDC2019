Whether you are planning to buy a new car, renovate your home or take a trip abroad, we provide the means to achieve your goal.`

All-purpose loan: a special loan in which your home serves as collateral for a loan you can take for any purpose.

Student loan: in order to give you peace of mind during your academic studies, we offer you a loan to finance your tuition fees as well as loans of up to NIS 60,000 with special terms.

Business loan: a whole raft of financing solutions, convenient terms, to help you grow your business, including small-business loans from a state-guaranteed fund, and a factoring service that turns your customer's debt into cash.`
